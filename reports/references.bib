abstract={The video game League of Legends has several professional leagues and tournaments that offer prizes reaching several million dollars, making it one of the most followed games in the Esports scene. This article addresses the prediction of the winning team in professional matches of the game, using only pregame data. We propose to improve the accuracy of the models trained with the features offered by the game application programming interface (API). To this end, new features are built to collect interesting information, such as the skills of a player handling a certain champion, the synergies between players of the same team or the ability of a player to beat another player. Then, we perform feature selection and train different classification algorithms aiming at obtaining the best model. Experimental results show classification accuracy above 0.70, which is comparable to the results of other proposals presented in the literature, but with the added benefit of using few samples and not requiring the use of external sources to collect additional statistics.},

abstract={Statistical Rethinking: A Bayesian Course with Examples in R and Stan builds readers' knowledge of and confidence in statistical modeling. Reflecting the need for even minor programming in today's model-based statistics, the book pushes readers to perform step-by-step calculations that are usually automated. This unique computational approach ensures that readers understand enough of the details to make reasonable choices and interpretations in their own modeling work.The text presents generalized linear multilevel models from a Bayesian perspective, relying on a simple logical interpretation of Bayesian probability and maximum entropy. It covers from the basics of regression to multilevel models. The author also discusses measurement error, missing data, and Gaussian process models for spatial and network autocorrelation.By using complete R code examples throughout, this book provides a practical foundation for performing statistical inference. Designed for both PhD students and seasoned professionals in the natural and social sciences, it prepares them for more advanced or specialized statistical modeling. Web ResourceThe book is accompanied by an R package (rethinking) that is available on the author's website and GitHub. The two core functions (map and map2stan) of this package allow a variety of statistical models to be constructed from standard model formulas.;Statistical Rethinking: A Bayesian Course with Examples in R and Stanbuilds readers' knowledge of and confidence in statistical modeling.
